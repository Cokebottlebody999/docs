### Flag your deep links

For the email links that you would like to deep link to content, add `$deep_link=true` to the URL as a query parameter, for example:

```html
<a href="links.example.com?$deep_link=true" >Link to your app!</a>
```

This will ensure that your links are converted to Branch links that will open the app on iOS and Android, with full tracking and attribution.
