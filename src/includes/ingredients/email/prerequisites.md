### Prerequisites

This guide requires you to have already [integrated the Branch SDK](/pages/apps/ios/) into your app.

To open the app directly on iOS 9.2+, you must configure your email integration and your app to support [Universal Links](/pages/deep-linking/universal-links/) in emails.

Contact your Branch Account Manager or [accounts@branch.io](mailto:accounts@branch.io) at any time for assistance with the setup steps.
