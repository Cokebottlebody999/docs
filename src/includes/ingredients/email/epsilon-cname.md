### Set up your click tracking domain

After you added and verified a click tracking domain you have to update DNS CNAME for it and point it to **`epsilon.thirdparty.bnc.lt`**. Once the CNAME record is added, please allow up to an hour for Branch to generate SSL and AASA files for your click tracking domain.
