!!! tip "Enable postbacks"
    Basic postbacks will automatically be activated for events like _Install_ and _Purchase_ when you enable your ad partner. You can then [add additional postbacks](#adding-more-postbacks), for example, if you wanted to add postbacks for custom events that are specific to your app like _Account Created_. You can also [edit postbacks](#advanced-editing-postbacks) if there's additional data you really need to pass along to your ad partner.
