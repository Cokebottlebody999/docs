!!! tip "Setting Attribution Windows"
	You can specify the attribution windows for your links either at an overall account or per link level. Use these windows to accurately measure attribution data for your Branch links. Refer to [Changing attribution windows](/pages/deep-linked-ads/branch-universal-ads/#change-attribution-windows) for instructions.

#### Configure an Ad

To set up a Video App Install campaign, you must first complete the entire creation flow for the campaign and ad on Google Adwords.

#### Troubleshooting

{! ingredients/deep-linked-ads/adwords-valuetrack-info.md !}

**Q: Why is my advertisement being disapproved on Adwords?**

**A:** For Video Campaigns, sometimes your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to Google Play or App Store when clicked on a desktop. Please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and a desktop redirect is set to either the App / Play store.

For Cross Platform campaigns, sometimes your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to your Final destination URL specified in the ad. Please ensure that your Branch link redirects to your Final URL specified in your ad. To ensure install tracking is functional please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and your Branch link's iOS/Android redirects are set to their respective App / Play Store.

**Q: Why can't I use a Branch link in a Video discovery ad?**

**A:** As of June 2017, Adwords does not support Tracking Templates on Video discovery ads. This means Branch links won't work for this specific ad type. However, we're working on support in the future and will update these docs accordingly.
